2G (GSM)

2G (GSM) Signal strength is defined by only one value: RSSI â€“ Received Signal Strength Indicator; RSSI is a negative value, and the closer to 0, the stronger the signal.
RSSI RSSI 	Signal strength 	Description
>= -70 dBm 	Excellent 	Strong signal with maximum data speeds
-70 dBm to -85 dBm 	Good 	Strong signal with good data speeds
-86 dBm to -100 dBm 	Fair 	Fair but useful, fast and reliable data speeds may be attained, but marginal data with drop-outs is possible
< -100 dBm 	Poor 	Performance will drop drastically
-110 dBm 	No signal 	Disconnection 


3G
RSSI 	Signal strength 	Description
>= -70 dBm 	Excellent 	Strong signal with maximum data speeds
-70 dBm to -85 dBm 	Good 	Strong signal with goodta speeds
-86 dBm to -100 dBm 	Fair 	Fair but useful, fast and reliable data speeds may be attained, but marginal data with drop-outs is possible
< -100 dBm 	Poor 	Performance will drop drastically
-110 dBm 	No signal 	Disconnection 


4G
> -65 dBm 	Excellent 	Strong signal with maximum data speeds
-65 dBm to -75 dBm 	Good 	Strong signal with good data speeds
-75 dBm to -85 dBm 	Fair 	Fair but useful, fast and reliable data speeds may be attained, but marginal data with drop-outs is possible
-85 dBm to -95 dBm 	Poor 	Performance will drop drastically
<= -95 dBm 	No signal 	Disconnection
